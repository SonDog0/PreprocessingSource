       "['It was almost oily feeling and didnt leave the green base to cover up my redness like I was expecting Not impressed with this at all Ive bought Nyx green in the past for my redness and it was awesome so not sure what happened with this one,Waste of money Threw in the garbage Way too sheer and the green did not work at all,Waaaay too small for the price and not really that good of a primer either,Pretty sure this product is not authentic or its expired The product separates a lot and seems really oily It also does NOTHING for redness,I previously got another green primer from NYX and I loved it It was so creamy and really reduced my redness However the consistency for this primer is off its more matte which is ok I was just surprised in comparison to my last NYX primer and it doesnt reduce my redness as much as my last primer did As for keeping my makeup on which is the goal for most primers I feel like it doesnt do much,Did not mask any redness on my face Its more of a regular primer not a redness cover up Absolutely useless for me,Im very disappointed in this because it is not the same product as in the tubes with the wands It is watery and then feels greasy and my skin is still showing red and dark circles,Very disappointed Didnt help reduce redness at all,It doesnt work,It feels Cakey and doesnt look natural under my liquid foundation,Feels greasy,I wanted to like this affordable product so much especially with all the good reviews But I felt like it broke my face out I dont like the way it feels either Im bummed about this purchase,Made my skin breakout,Pretty sure this isnt the same product I usually buy Ive usedthis product for years to mix into foundations that are too yellow for my very fair skin tone the formula is not the same at all,Terrible primer Doesnot fill pores for smooth look,I liked it and used it but it caused my skin to break out When I stopped using it my skin was healthier no pimples Maybe it just didnt work well on my skin,Dont recommend this,I purchased this product to cover broken veins and to conceal my big pores It didnt do either Total waste of money,Terrible quality This is runnyoily doesnt show up no concealingpriming or green color and has an unpleasant odor I used it once and immediately washed it off A color correcting crayon though very dry is a better choice,I think this may have been a counterfeit productIt was very thin nearly watery and it did not hide or cover red in any way The product normally works which I why I wonder if it is fakebut the packaging looked real I threw it outcomplete waste of money,Doesnt really accomplish what I purchased it for Too thin Also the sizeamount is a bit less than as advertised,Your browser does not support HTML videoLooks like old product,I ordered the green one and I bought this to cover my redness but this works the same as the clear one I was expecting this to be thicker paste so it could color correct the red but it did no covering Its a nice primer if you have nothing to cover but this is supposed to cover redness so Im giving it one star Save your money if you actually need a color corrector,I wanted to find something not as expensive but clearly you get what you pay for No good smell I cant tell if it changes my skin tone The only good thing is the silky smooth feel I will not purchase again,Dont waste your money honestly,Cheap products,Makes my foundation flake off Feels super oily,This product does nothing for redness It basically goes on clear It also is a terrible primer This product is greasy and my makeup slides off my face when I try to apply it over this primer If you want something redness reducing I suggest ErborianCC Color Correcting  Redness Reducing Broad Spectrum SPF  Its more expensive but it actually does reduce redness,Doesnt spread as easy as other related products,Does nothing to cover rednessNothing but an oily lotion,Its not good at all A waist of money,It doesnt even cover any of my redness Its more of a moisturizer,While this primer makes my skin feel silky smooth it does little if anything to correct the redness in my face,I got this product to help with my pores and it seemed like it enhanced my pores more then anything I tried with and without moisturizer first Ive tried a different foundation and kept getting the same results Does not work Would not recommend,My face has a lot of redness so I had high hopes that this green primer would help diffuse the redness a bit It did not Not at all However it does work good as a primer,I have red skinI bought this to tone under my makeupIt is too sheerhelps only a littleBut not worth it,This is not a cover up or corrector its an oily green tinted lotion that doesnt do anything but make skin feel greasy,Oily runny doesnt do anything for redness Complete waste of money,if youre looking for a moisturizing product likely look elsewhere this is an extremely thick and slick solution that immediately caused my face to feel tight and my foundation lasts longer without this product,Greasy Doesnt do anything,When I first opened the product it was great but after about a week of not using it all the oil has separated and wont mix with the rest of the product anymore I tried shaking it and putting it in my beauty fridge but its no use,This does not do what it is advertised asIt does not remove any redness at all,I LOVE anything NYX and Im so disappointed by this It makes my concealer get goopy and clumpy around my nose Wouldnt recommend it,Doesnt work like at all Face is just as red And its REALLY greasy Save your money,Completely useless against redness Granted I think I have more redness than someone with darker skin tones Im very pale but there was literally NO difference when I put this on one side of my face to compare with the side without product Also a very nasty greasy feeling Makes it difficult for liquid foundation to go on top of it Very disappointed,Item is old Does not matter how often or how hard I shake the bottle it does not mix When I try to squeeze some out it is just oilIt has absolutely no coverage,I got the green primer for redness color correction It does nothing  absolutely nothing  to correct the red It also feels like Im covering my face in cooking grease Lovely,Whomever said this primer is the best is dead wrong This is the absolute worst It does nothing but moisturize my skin a little Does not help with redness Does not help foundation last longer Does not help with anything I do not recommend this to anyone If you want an inexpensive primer use Hard Candy brand primer,If you are looking for a primer this one is greatIf you are looking to have your Rosacea covered this does nothing to cover the redness,This product is a waste of money at any priceProvides absolutely NO coverage of red or bruised areas under coverup or body makeup Dont waste your money,This product does not work at allIts fake news and snake oil,It smells bad and looks very fake,It doesnt really apply well,Its not the best as stated,This product doesnt work at all It is greasy doesnt absorb and most importantly doesnt help with redness There are great products out there but they are much MUCH more expensive Unfortunately,Someone took pkg and I need photo of item and all info so I can collect Do you have cs phone  I am  and need help  pkgs taken the nd was the pink tubeMalley which was delivered I need someone to help me collect for them Please connect me with help Thx,I thought I would try this since it is cheaper than the product I usually use smashbox but it is not even close to providing the coverage than smashbox doesIt just makes the skin very oily and the foundation looks shiny after applying over this primer,I bought this because of the reviews but honestly was not impressed I dont know if it was the batch that I got but it was really oily and the texture was just off,I was very excited to use this primer because it has tons of great reviews however Im not a fan It does go on smooth and gives your face a silky feel so thats great but it did nothing when it came to redness My cheeks have a natural red tint and throughout the day my foundation wears off and reveals it I thought this green primer would fix it but it did not,If youre looking for a product to cover redness even a little bit this is NOT the product for you It doesnt cover any redness or dark marks,Saved money but it wasnt worth it Going back to Laura Geller Spackle,This stuff is like greencolored grease or somethingDoes nothing to combat redness and leaves a dreadful greasy residueTruly terrible,This was not very green and did not control or cover redness like advertised,Breaks my skin out Also when applying my foundation it wasnt easy applying it because it felt as if I was wearing a mask If you have oily skin it doesnt work At least not with me,Doesnt have staying power Makes my skin oily after a while,I bought this because it was cheap and a larger size than my normal Elf Product Alas I will go back to Elf  The Elf primer causes my makeup to distribute easily across my skin but this primer does not Two stars bc its better than no primer at all,Does not cover the redness,I suspect this was counterfeitIt was greasy chemicalsmelling the packaging didnt match the official NYX websiteand it didnt seem like the same level of quality of packaging or product that NYX usually hasIt was also underpricedI returned itI opened it and couldnt stand the smell and was disgusted by the oozy grease leaking out when I got ready to use it,It comes off after  min So when I rub my face to put concealer or foundation after primer it just peels off like dead skin,Nice coverage under foundation but clogs pores and caused breakouts Would not recommend,I have finally pinned down that this primer is what Im allergic to while Im doing my makeup Its nothing severe although it does seem like it gets worse with each use Now that I have discovered its the primer it went straight in the garbage I never had issues with the product when I purchased at the store so Im assuming this one is fake and there is an ingredient in it that shouldnt be,Caused me to break out My skin was very angry after using this,Dont buy,Wouldnt use again,It was a clear wet gel that took forever to dry and didnt seem to do anything,For some reason my eyes start watering when I wear thisIt might not bother others,Really thin and oily My foundation just slid around on this primer It didnt do anything for my redness either,The packaging is great and easy to use Didnt make my makeup last longer or help cover my acne,Not a good primer at all,Very oily product Made me break out,Not happy gives a sensation of silk,This product is fake see the original photo On Amazon,Very oilyDid not cover rosacea,it comes out almost clear so does nothing for your redness on your face I even did it on only one side of my face to see if it made any difference but did NOTHING it comes out so clear almost as if nothing was there A clear green tinged cream,This product did absolutely nothing to prime my skin,Did not make a difference in my red complexion I am not a fan,Didntdo as advertised,Was not very thick so it didnt seem to mask redness like I figured it could,Dont buy this product as it is fake When comparing packaging and ingredients listed and shown directly on the NYX website this product does not match The super low price less than  compared to around  at Walmart should have been a red flag The packaging looks so close you would never know unless you looked closely but it is missing trademark symbols has text that is difficult to read and the ingredients dont quite match those listed on the NYX website I read some other more buried reviews that also reported this being a counterfeit dupe Lesson learned Im just glad I didnt put the product on my facewho knows what is in it,Maybe it was just my face but this primer made my skin look pale and ashy I also did not the way it felt on my face,Im  or  inches from my mirror and I cant tell that the product has done anything Theres virtually no difference before and after I put it on Really angers me when I feel like I completely wasted my money,This product did zero to tone down natural red undertones I found another one that I could try before I buy that actually worked a miracle Dont waste your money This will do nothing to calm down redness however it does have a silky feel and Im going to use it until its gone because I HATE to throw away money,I used this spray primer as directed but it made it very difficult to apply my foundationWhen I finally got it on it was very uneven and cakey It looked terrible I must be doing something wrong because it didnt do anything for me that all the videos Ive watched promised Ill just go back to using my foundation on top of my moisturizer and skip the primer,This never showed up and it stank a lotThose girls were born into a good life,Not really impressed It felt soft and went on smoothly but it definitely did not decrease the appearance of pores or fine lines at all In fact it did the complete opposite My face looks more leathery and texturey with this mess on I wont be purchasing again and do recommend spending a little extra for a good primer,Terrible product Did not cover any redness whatsoever the consistency is very watery In fact it made my skin even more red Dont waste your time and money in this product,I got this because the reviews made it sound promising but I wish I hadnt wasted the money My foundationconcealer still cracked and looked awful when I was wearing it I tried it a bunch of ways to see if it was just one thing I tried withwithout applying mousterizer I tried it with just foundation tried it with just concealer tried it withwithout finishing spray Didnt work no matter what,The stuff feels sticky but when you apply it has not primer effect other than drying out the skin If I were you would save the money and not get it,The green tint does absolutely nothing I would recommend LA Girls green concealer over this product by a mile if youre trying to hide redness or counter warmth in your foundation,This primer is heavy Even if I waited a while before applying foundation and used the softest foundation application brush this primer does not stand up or layer well,This product didnt improve the tone of my skin at all Made no difference,Not for me,This primer is horrible Greasy and does not cover anything Do not recommend and would send back if I could,I didnt like this primer and it didnt like me back I dont think it did anything,the green tint in this primer is supposed to counter a ruddy complexion but the product instantly turned my face seriously redwherever I used it immediately went dark red and I was very relieved when it returned to normal blotchy red after I washed it offback to square one,When I put it on it felt good on my face however after applying foundation it caused my face to flake Strange,Did It work for me at all Was using product to off set the red in my faceAlso so slippery I was so hoping it would help,I used this product for several weeks to reduce redness on my skin but I unfortunately me at saw a change,made me light,This did not help reduce or even the tone on my skin at all Perhaps if someone had very good coloring with occasional splotches but not at all for uneven skin tone,This does not negate red color in face Total waste of money,This made my skin more oily and only lasted part of the the day,The bottle was half full,Not good primer,Very thin Did not cover skin redness,Doesnt neutralize redness as well as I had hoped,I tried this product after using a different brand more recently This product is very greasy and I received no added longevity of my makeup Going back to my old brand,I would not recommend This is not a dupe for smash box as I had hoped,Gummed up immediately Not ideal for layerering you foundation,This is not the real product It does nothing for color correcting at all Feels so greasy and horrible When i took it off at the end of the day my red cheeks and neck i have roscea those the need for color correcting was redder and splotchier then it normally is,This mask is too thin to workI tried putting on two coats and it still tears off in schards too thin to workI wont buy again,I normally use Colorescience All Calm and I LOVE the product  it feels great on my skin greatly reduces the redness and has SPF I decided to look around for another redness reducer that is friendlier to the wallet but this product is NOT the solutionAs a primer it is simply OK  it glides on well but feels more like a gel similar to a product Ive used in the pastPerhaps it simply doesnt work well with my liquid foundation but the mix is horribleOnly after I add the powder can I step out in publicAs a redness reducer it does not work at allFAILOverall extremely disappointed in this product,Not at all matte  does nothing for my skin The green is clear and no less shine,I really wanted to like this product I loved the feel of it on my skin right after I applied it Then I put some concealer over it and it was like it rubbed off Like silicone glue I would use it when Im not wearing any facial makeup,This did absolutely nothing to help with redness or discoloration or as a primer Cant believe it got any good reviewsJust happened to pick up Cover girl green primer while I was at CVS and it works great,Sadly contained leaked some of the liquid during shipment  container was covered on it Sis not have time to return,This product does feel smooth on my skin but does nothing to cover the redness Will not purchase again,Im not a huge fan of primers as most seem to make me breakout but this did not I didnt notice a big difference in using this product compared to no primer so I dont think I would purchase it again,I wanted to love this after reading so many of the positive reviews on it and I liked that it was crueltyfree but I was highly disappointedFrom the first use this primer left my entire face feeling greasy and disgusting as if I hadnt washed my face in a week I endured it for a couple of uses knowing my face tends to have dry skin from time to time Even with moisturizer and using it for a month the feeling did not change or improve And it also did not help with smoothing fine lines and pores in my skin  I felt like it made them more apparent actuallySo while this primer may not be for me It might work for you Everyone has different skin and things can feel different from person to person But this is not a good primer if you have dry skin from my experience If dry skin isnt an issue for you I say give it a shot and see if you like it Its the only way youll really know,The quality is REPULSIVE Do not waste your money this looks and feels cheap like something from the dollar store and doesnt work well at all I think it made me break out a little also If I could give zero stars I would,I was hoping this was a good dupe for my smashbox photo finish but it wasnt When you use it it starts to clump and come off in rubbery pieces Stopped using it  LOVE THIS BRAND but this product just didnt work for me,There are far better similarly priced primers out there ELF is really good,Product arrived in a sandwich bag looked at tube its so old I could not read any of the printing or faded away in spots Cant use this not sure if expired or if its what I ordered,Asco de producto me saco espinillas,Made my face dry and flaky,This is the worst primer I have ever used Makeup looked very caked on after a few hours of wear and also gave me an orange glow after a couple hours,Muy poco producto,I thought it was very thin and didnt really cover the red like it says,I was really looking forward to this product and was quite disappointed when it arrived and I found out hell runny and watery it wasIts more like goop than it is a sicker foundation type productsIt barely has any green collor and does not cover red at allFor me it is completely useless Disappointing,This primer is not for oily skin I have never had a problem with my make up rubbing off but with this stuff I couldnt even touch my face slightly without my makeup rubbing off And rather I touched my nose or not the make up would be off after about five hours I just stopped using it today and my make up was flawless and stayed all day It also takes a lot of product to cover the face,Not a fan I love this brands product however this product is super oily and watery Not at all what I expected I will pay more and buy a better product,Very very light and once blended in you cant see any difference It is also very greasy,Some days its gloopy some days its really liquidy and nasty I heard this product is good Im disappointed,Broke my skin out in just one use,Left my complexion oily,Doesnt work dont buy,This does absolutely nothing for me Its a clear gel and doesnt fill or cover or anything I might as well have put water on my face Ill stick with my Benefit primer,EXTREMELY oily for skin,Had previously purchased NYX Studio Perfect Primer Green from a local store and liked the product When I ran out I purchased this product from Amazon in June The packaging and formula from the Amazon product differed from what I purchased in sore The Amazon version was oily and goopy the writing on the packaging was faint and difficult to read In the photo left is store bought right Amazon boughtIn terms of the product itself purchased from the store I like the feel of it and it does a good job providing a smooth surface on which to apply my foundationAlthough the product claims to color correct I have seen no redness reduction in my skin when I use the product I will repurchase in store,I bought this in green to correct red spots This product doesnt do much of anythingIt disappears immediately after dabbing it onto my skin Before I even get a chance to blotblend its gone Ive tried applying larger amounts even excessive amounts and it still doesnt conceal any redness I always shake before use but it always seems to squirt out separated half green and half liquid,Very oily,This does not work well on my face it felt like an oil slick after putting makeup on However somehow I started putting it on my feet It made them feel really smooth and not sweaty ,Ill stick with the more expensive brandsThis one does not help much with keeping the shine down,I did not like this product at all It was a waste of my money It leftmy face with like this white clear peel it never even was able to spreadhow it should,Like others I had the issues of this product only functioning as a primer There was no redness reduction I even applied the primer to half my face and waited a few hours to compare Sadly no difference,I though this would help cover the redness of the face but it doesnt it is just a regular primer that looks green but it does not cover the red areas of the face as expected,Product was very oily separated and smeary I sent it back,DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER THIS IS A KNOCK OFF AND NOT THE REAL ITEM PICTURED I just received mine and it is not whats in the picture You can see the label difference in my pictures and the product feels totally different than the real thing,Greasy and does not cover at all Complete crap,I received a FAKE I didnt even notice at firstbut then my skin started turning red and blotchy When I inspected the packaging I noticed that the one I received looks different than advertised by the seller as well as the NYX website Upon even further inspection I found spelling errors on the front and back Come on guys I dont even know what this garbage is made of and I feel disgusted having put it on my skin ,Had poor consistency and did not apply well,Didnt provide good coverage or balance to my face,Did absolutely nothing,Horrible oily and very runny consistency Will not buy again,Product does not work to blend and correct skin toneTry another option',\n",

those who are looking to learn how to do makeup but dont want to spend a lot of money upfront,I usually mix this with my foundation and it makes it super light on my skin The primer itself is very light on the skin as well It makes your face very smooth even with just little product  would recommend ,This product is everything it claims to be Love it,Just got it today LOVE IT Works so well and my makeup looked great all day all night,Ive always used this brand of primer Many different types in this brand Good pricing too,This stuff minimizes wrinklesFeels so soft I love it,I finally got to open it up and try it I loved it Highly recommend,This primer is awesome Its smooth and does the job Also moisturizes,I dont know much about makeup but this was recommended and I am so happy with it I absolutely love it and will never wear my makeup without it again,The primer was super easy to apply I used my fingers as I feel like that would be the best application as it feels like a more siliconebased primer I used it with my stick foundation and it was great EXCEPT near my nose area oddly When I applied my foundation the foundation wouldnt adhere properly and looked like it was cracking and dry Which didnt make sense to me I think you should proceed with caution if you use a stick foundation but if you use a liquid style foundation I feel like there would not be as many bad interactions,It works Makeup comes out looking flawless,Love this primer Great price and same quality as my high end make up primers Definitely recommend,Great primer I was very hesitant at first bc Im used to high end products but this surprised me in a great way If u have any redness on ur skin as I do sometimes this primer works wondersUnbelievable shipping received product earlier than I had expectedThank u so much,Great primer for great price I have been using Estee Lauder or Laura Gellar for years which are both around  This NYX works just as good nice smooth finish to apply foundation I really dont see a difference especially since I only paid  Granted the others are  oz tubes and this is  oz but still would be half the price Is sold,I do not notice a difference in how my foundation applies with this Oh well,Ive never used a primer and I love this stuff,Love how it goes on,I switched to this from the Smashbox original Photo Finish primer which was my holy grail primer in terms of functionality but unfortunately would break me out if I used it too frequently I really like that this NYX version has a more stripped down ingredients list that is a lot more friendly to sensitive skinAt the same time this primer isnt quite as good It provides a very smooth silky canvas and smoothes over texture well but it is a lot less oilcontrolling This is a great choice for dry or combodry skin but less so for oily or combooily,Oh my goodness the tiniest bit makes my skin so soft  its like magicIt did not work for my waterbased foundation though  took some research to realize the oilwater issue is why it was clumping up immediatelyI still use it when Im not rocking foundation like a just highlighter day though and I love it,LOVED IT,Ive been wearing foundation without a primer every day for  yearsI never thought I needed one until I tried thisI have missed out on so muchIt makes my makeup application look so smooth and lasts into late eveningUsually by the end of the day I look washed out because my foundation lasts only  hoursNow I look fresh faced all dayI decided on using primer with the hopes of preventing my foundation from rubbing off onto my covid face maskIt does minimize rub off but I still see mask lines on my cheeks and foundation on my maskI used too much primer one day under my mask and my skin ended up looking chalky and awfulIm thinking about trying out a  hour foundation with this primer,Skin type oily and sensitiveTone warmColor mediumlight pralineMy skin is oily and I also use a sunscreen that adds a little more shine I hoped to use this without makeup in order to matteify my skin It reduces shine a lot but only for a short while About an hour later my skin was shiny again The antiredness effect is subtle but it workstldr great as a primer with makeup but not longlasting enough for allday shine control,My first time using a primer and I gotta day I noticed a huge difference Foundation went on much smoother makeup stayed on longer and I usually get oily by the end of the day but with this product I can say I look  less oily This product has definitely changed my game,Great size for price,Does great,I debated whether I should put three stars or four Its an excellent primer so four it is Better than most primers Ive used in the past However as a redness concealer Im disappointed It doesnt make a difference on my rosacea whatsoeverOverall Ive become a big fan of NYXs products in general,I have used this product for two years now and cant live without itIt is perfect for those with oily or combination skin as it just smooths the skinIf you dont feel like wearing foundation this is a nice alternative However when wearing foundation this is sort of like an amazing clear spackle for ones faceHighly recommend,A little goes a long way Ive used baby skin primer and had to use a decent amount and then my skin was left feeling greasy This NYX primer is extremely lightweight even if you were to accidentally use more than usual Its quick to dry and does the job to hide pores and linesWill definitely be buying again,Pro  Goes on easily  smoothly is nicely sheer other makeup Eg blush goes on like a glove no scent Con  Would like if came in a larger size,Gives me a smooth finish,Great primer no scent and doesnt clog pores I have cystic acne and sensitive skin and it does not effect that I prefer a matte look verse shiny and this does the job,Me encanto,Love this product So light and smoothing,I really enjoy this primer I have fine lines and dry skin and was looking for something silicone based to help fill in my fine lines and work well with all the moisturizer I have on my face I love the silky texture of this product truly feels incredible on the skin lightweight helped with moisturizing and best part was that it DID help to fill in my fine lines especially near my eyes so my makeup looked much much more flawless and smooth I highly recommend,Product glides on great gives me a smooth finish Filla in most pores and lines just not he deep set ones in the forehead Will definitely keep buying,Great product,Gave as a gift,Have never used a base product so I didnt know what to expect Surprised by how wonderful it made my base look Less flaws and pores showing on my face,Wonderful product I hadnt used toner before but it made a good deal of difference for me,I really like this It seems to blur very slightly and makes my skin look softer and a little younger who wouldnt want that I dont even bother with foundation anymore I simply use a good moisturizer I recommend Jason Natural Cosmetics Vitamin E cream and this product Just be sure to let your moisturizer dry well before applying this over it Apply sparingly as a little goes a long way,This really helped to firm  tighten my skin while covering flaws and I have many Great coverage with finer lines and smoothed out my skin It lays well under makeup Leaves your face feeling soft I recommend,Doesnt have a sent Which is good I will use this if I run out of my favorite kind I love Farmasi brand It glides on smoothly This one not as slick But still a good primer,I love this product it never disappoints me and I will continue to buy it on Amazon,Perfect Does exactly what it says and doesnt break me out LOVE,This went on smoothly covering fine lines  making a smooth surface for the rest of my makeup especially that pesky undereye area,This is so good It goes on easily and leaves a silky texture My skin feels smooth and less red It evens my skin tone and makes applying makeup much easier,Good,Good stuff,Awesome,My favourite one,Great product last long The smell is a little off but its still worth the buy,This stuff works so good Im having trouble with my make up coming off on my nose no matter what I use Im in Texas so Im ALWAYS sweating and Im pregnant Today I used it for the first time and none of my make up came off with my sweat,My go to As good as MAC,I love this product,Best primer I have ever used,NYX products as long as they are discounted appropriately are good products There is a tendency for some to over price but I would only buy products that are cheaper than those at the cosmetic stores,Exactly what I was looking for,Just as good if not better than Smashbox primer for three times the costWont buy expensive primers anymoreNYC has nice quality makeup,It is literally skin blurring and does the job I pair this with NYX Matte setting spray for a beautiful finish,I like it makes makeup last way longer,I love this product It is amazing I love how it feels,I really like this primer A little goes a long way and makes my face feel really soft and smooth The price is really good too,So buttery smooth on my face No irritation really helps the rest of my makeup stay on through out the day Good amount of product for the price Would buy again,It was great Will order again,I love how smooth and quickly it works to minimize shine Its not going to mattify your face like a highend primer but it works well enough for daily use and i will be buying more I use it as part of my daily sunscreen routine and it leaves my face looking fresh and hydrated I dont know how long it lasts since I just use it to get me through short distances in the sun but will be updating on that later,I like how soft it makes my skin and blends my makeup well,Great product for the price,This is a great primer As soon I put it on it felt so smooth It is silicone based but it was very blurring and didnt settle into any fine lines or cracks It wore well and I enjoy it,NYX Primer is a great productI have been spending  on a different primer for the same size bottleI will continue using this product,The primer does its job its smooth and a whitish clear color scent free and is a over all great product I have to add a little drip of lotion to it as it dies not have any moisturizing properties to it After application with out using the lotion my skin began to peel n dry out around eye and brow area As well as deying out my nose and causing pealing With added lotion this does not happen at all I love NYX,Helps cover up redness Love this product Will definitely buy again,This by far is the best primer Ive used I tried a couple but this takes the crown Will definitely buy again,I am dedicated to this product I buy it every month I have very sensitive acne prone skin and this is the only color correcting primer Ive been able to use It hides redness beautifully and its very lightweight,Doesnt really cover red like I had expected it to but it doubles as a great primer Great price,I like it Definitely cheaper than the  SBox brand Works great to make my pores smaller,I have been looking for a Smashbox dupe and this is the closest I have found I get nervous ordering makeup and hair products on Amazon but I felt it was the real product because it was packaged well Regardless I like it and the price is way better than Smashbox Seems to be moisturizing as well So if you have drier skin this is a nice product,Creates a nice blur effect for skin flaws I wear it under my foundation Its like a primer and helps smooth out the foundation Arrived on time,This primer does exactly as described I like to look cute on a budget so this is now my new go to primer My makeup looks flawless My concealer would crease under my eyes over time Not anymore Im completely

for me without touch up  sometimes ,Very good primer,I have skin with a lot of pink undertones Therefore its necessary for me to use a green primer to look my best And since Im out among the public singing very often its necessary for me to look my best and take care of my skin This primer gets rid of the excessive pink undertones in my skin and allows me to use tinted moisturizer instead of foundation unless of course Im going to be on stage and then stage makeup is necessary This primer glides on nicely and evenly It isnt too thick but it does cover the pink and evens out my skin tone Its pretty creamy so a little goes a long way making this a good bang for your buck I have dry skin so I use a lot of moisturizing products and I find this primer is moisturizing as well I can recommend this highly to anyone who has pink undertones they want to tone down If you have yellow undertones this is the wrong primer for you Everyone is different but I find this lasts all day for me If I apply it at  am it and my tinted moisturizer will still look fine at  or  pm especially if I use the setting spray made by the same company Highly recommended to all who have excessive pink undertones in their skin and want to eliminate them,This works almost as well as the Smashbox primerIt does lack a little longevity but for the price difference it is totally worth it to me,Perfect,Great stuff just as good as more expensive brands Kept my makeup on all day and felt less greasy,I like the texture of the product,I tried this since it had decent reviews and was so cheap

prime my face and make my foundation last longer,Love this  keeps my beat fresh for hours,I adore this product I still try other primers on occasion but I always come back to this one,I am so shocked at how amazing this primer is For the last three years I have bought so many expensive high end primers trying to find the holy grail  this is it and at an unbeatable price,A little went a long way I purchased  tubes and I just finished a tube of this after using daily for over  months After reading reviews I use less than a dimesize amount and mix it with a tinted beauty balm to smooth out my

special occasions This product is very good for the price,Great to smooth,I liked,Good product,This doesnt colorcorrect I would say it is OK for a primer for this price Green becomes translucent immediately,Okay so I bought this because I ran out of my other color correcting primer This doesnt really color correct like it intends too Infact if I were to just wear this Id still be pretty pink BUT Ive found Ive I put it in a thicker layer all over my face it blurs my pores like no other AND helps make my foundation more opaque If youre planning on using this on its own to color correct and tone down redness without foundation I cant recommend it But If you are planning on using it as a primer and then following it up with foundation as it is intended you cant go wrong Just make sure youre applying liberally Also this in combo with the nyx matte setting spray Absolutely magical full coverage and lasts allllll day,Makes such a huge difference in how your make up comes out and lasts Inexpensive but not cheap and worth it,in stores is about  but I always order on here its the best price it ships fast and it comes to my door cant beat that it fills your pores very well great texture doesnt really have a smell which is good,Love this product gives my foundation all day wear I also carefully apply to my eyelids under my eyeshadow and my shadow lasts all day into the evening No creasing,I have been using this primer for a few years now and I love it It has the same texture as Smashbox Photo Finish primer but it is way more affordable Using a primer really does make my face look smoother my makeup stay on better and longer and keeps my face from looking cakey later in the day The purple helps balance you out if you have yellow undertones in your skin like me Great product,Love it,Softens the face rendering it very smooth for applying makeup flawlessly,Great stuff,I think its worth the price but I havent noticed a huge difference versus similar products that makes this stick out I prefer something more moisturizing also But overall I like the way it feels and the way it goes on my skin,Wow what a great product Feels so good when applying really smoothed out my enormous pores and stopped the issues I was having with my makeup namely getting dewysweating off my face Really makes all my makeup stay put,It made my makeup look so smooth,This is an amazing primer for the price It definitely helps my makeup set more smoother on top,Does take away some of the shine Great product for such a low price,Great product and so affordable,Love it Nyx is one if my go to makeup products,A clear primer is important to me as a whiteopaque primer changes the color of your skinI dont put foundation on my whole face so a clear primer allows to prime my whole face and only apply foundation where I need it on the trouble spots,Keeps my makeup on all day However elf is  for theyre primer and Ill definitely be moving to that,It make skin smooth A very nice product I

moisturizerPrimer is preferably unscentedMakeup base goes on smoothlyDoes not pill after applicationNYX not only meets my criteria it exceeds them I normally apply moisturizer after showering allowing

versions Ive tried Definitely recommend,I love the way it absorbed into my skin and the way it allows for the makeup application to be seamless,beautiful thingsbetter prices,I love this product,This is my new go to primerI have used expensive primers before and this product works just as wellLasts all day and then some,amazing product,I love this primer It works just as well as the upscale brands

like everything about this primer It goes on smooth keeps my makeup smooth and the biggy is it makes fine lines practically disappear I will be ordering again,Goes on smoothly and feels quite nice Lasts all day It covers general redness but any blatant splotchiness will not be covered I have quite a few of those and will go over them with an additional green concealer stick and also a red concealer for darker spots The NYX green primer does contribute along with the concealer sticks to toning those trouble spots down more so that they are not so obvious than just using the concealer sticks alone I am very happy with this purchase Great product More so after having learned that NYX is crueltyfree On the other hand I am on the fence as to whether I will continue to purchase this I understand LOreal the parent company of NYX is not crueltyfree So debating whether purchasing NYX products would be the same as continuing to purchase products that are animaltested I would like to try and steer away from that now,Great product for the cost,Q llego puntual,It does the job and helps my makeup last longer,Good working for me,One of my all time favorite brands and favorite primers,Love this product,Love this primer It is silky and smooth perfect base for a cream or liquid foundation and very affordable Great product for the price I dont use it for the redness reduction so I cant speak on that aspect but I do like the feel and consistency better than the NYX clear primer which is stilla nice primer,I love this product Ive used one of those very expensive name brands and I feel like this works just as well I also love the fact that it has the color correcter built in I get two products in one Outstanding,LADIES if youre looking for a primer look no further This primer is THEE BEST Ive tried Setting powder It showed up every tiny little crease and wrinkle Especially under my eyes Who wants that PLUS when I applied my mascaradidnt matter if I waited about  minutes before applying foundation or used many many different mascaras my mascara would leave little black spots under my eyes Little mascara tracks Raccoon eyes I could walk in a store and see myself and BAM A Raccoon starting back at me  NYX STUDIO PERFECT is just that  PERFECT  NO mascara tracks No Raccoon eyesIve waited a few days to write this review so I could use different mascaras thinking either I found the PERFECT product or is just a combination of NYX and certain mascara NOPE Its NYX for sure I can even nap with a full face of makeup on and wake up and look like its freshly put on PLUS it doesnt accentuate any small lines under my eyesIf youre hesitating just get this miracle in the black bottle Youll be very happy as I amPs Im going to visit my bf for three months and Im buying enough bottles to hold me over Not sure if his country carries this Sure as hell not taking any chanceS,Great base Love it,I used to buy Smashboxs primers till I read an article that this NYX was basically the sameFor a few bucks I figured why not try itMy  year old niece and myself have never paid for expensive primer sinceI cant say the same for other similar items like mascara I always spend the extraIn this case though it was worth it,I dont know much about primer or make up but this keeps my eye makeup on all day long,So heres the thing in terms of giving you a smooth start and helping makeup stay on your face longer this primer is excellent If it was marketed as just your standard primer Id give it  stars However there was no color correcting effect from the green It did not in any way diminish the red undertones in my skin,This brand is highly rated on Google so I thought Id give it a tryit smooths and evens out my skin before applying Bare Minerals makeuphave worn without makeup for casual days and my look is still smooth  pulled together I have combo skin and this primer works well for me,Works like a charm makeup application better,Worked as expected,Pretty decent primer,Easy to use,for sure a better value dupe for the smashbox primer keeps my skin looking smooth under my makeup not greasyshiny great texture,primer before foundation,So

all WOW I have tried dozens of primers in my life Wasted well over  dollars on primers that didnt work or didnt last NYX seemed to be everyones secret weapon so I decided ro give it a whirl Its notably a lot cheaper than most other primers Ive tried so I was skeptical but I am HOOKED on this stuff I have a combinationoily face and its hard to get makeup that will stay put all day without looking patchy or sliding around but this primer works miracles My large pores around my tzone are hard to smooth out but this just glides over them and makes it so easy to apply my medium coverage foundation  just make sure you blend it into your skin well so it doesnt feel slippery across your face I do have troublesome skin but this gives me the smoothest makeup application that lasts from  in the morning til  when I take it all off Seriously a holy grail,Super soft on face and helps foundation glide right on,The product arrived quickly and appears to be a good valueIt goes on smooth and wears well My only complaint is that it doesnt work well with my favorite concealer causing some cakingand leaving me to need either a different concealer or a different primerWhen using the primer without concealer Ive been very pleased It does not irritate my skin or cause breakouts My skin actually looks better with a light priming and setting powder I will buy again,Been using this for years and years the only primer I use if you have oily or combination skin this will be perfect mattifies your face without drying it out just make sure you moisturize first but thats with any makeup

and sometimes eyeliner difficult to wear This stays all day and without creasing,I use high end cosmetics but this primer works just like the more expensive onesHighly recommend and I hope NYX does not stop making it,This primer is a clear lightweight gel It goes on like butter and leaves your skin completely shinefree and so soft After applying my foundation and lightweight loose powder my skin and makeup stay beautiful all day through any temperature I love this product Thats why Im on Autodelivery,I love nyx products so Im excited to try this on my next photo shoot All of their primers

problems It has improved the look and wear of my makeup,Good primer for the money feels comparable to more expensive ones,OK,How is my make up go on so well and it looks so great,Just as nice as the expensive product I bought at the salon,This product works like and expensive high end productbut wont brake the bank,Works great ,This is a dupe for Smashbox photofinish primer It goes on very smooth and blurs fine lines and minimizes the appearance of pores I highly recommend this primer at a third of the price of the higher end product,It works great for me Keeps me from breaking out when I do a full make up and for the price you cant beat it,Would buy again Great primer Lasts all day until you take it off at night,Did a great job,I didnt use it personally but my daughter has no complaints at all,Buen producto,Im just going to preface this by saying I know next to nothing about makeup I used to use tinted moisturizer some powder blush and call it a day One of my kids was getting married and I wanted to step up my game and make sure I had complete foundation coverage all day This stuff works I have always moisturized before putting on the tinted moisturizer Now I moisturize wait a while then use this primer then a good foundation The primer keeps the foundation on and helps it spread more evenly Im sold,This is definitely the best primer I have tried It has the same texture as Milani which has been my favorite for many years but it sets into my skin better My skin also looks less oily with it I highly recommend I took off a star because it went from  up to  for the same small size A little disappointing,Excelente transaccin ,Feels good on the skin but  oz is too small a size and the tube didnt last long Not sure if I will order again I use serums that seem to work just as well as a primer,I like the durabilityMy only complaint is its difficult to use all of the product in the container I have to cut the tube to get the last of the product out Usually  to  uses,I bought this back when I believed in primer Its a little greasy but one of the least bad primers Ive ever tried so its a good buy,This primer does a great job of smoothing out your skin and getting it ready for foundation and it does effect my skin except making it nice and smooth,Great silk like feel I love it Well worth the money,My favorite Primer,This keeps my Tzone from getting shiny throughout the day Love,I like this primer for its satin like feeling and a little goes a long way I use it before my bare minerals makeup for a super soft smooth look,WowWho on earth thought a

It makes my foundation look great through a long day I apply it between moisturizer and foundation for great results,A great dupe for the much more expensive Smashbox photo ready primer Long lasting smooth application and helps create a nice even canvas for foundation and concealer,Smooth application and really helps with the look of my BB cream,goes on smooth love it,It works well just a little greasy for my taste but it did keep my makeup in place all day,First time using a primerIt definitely makes a difference in the texture of my foundationCant really compare it to others but I like this one and will continue to buy,For the size of the bottle its definitely over priced I have no tried it yet but if I do end up loving the product Ill probably end up going into the store to buy it instead of paying over  for a small tube of primer thatll probably be gone in less than a month,It works Greatits my favorite,Omg makes your makeup application amazing,I decided to try this product because it was rated much lower on the Think Dirty app than the primer I was usingIt goes on smoothly and easily and leaves a silky smooth type of feeling after applicationI did not need to allow any time for drying before adding my foundationIt seems to work just as well as my previous primer but it s much cleaner rated  on Think Dirty appI will be buying this again unless I find a  rated primer

buy,Ive tried many different types of primers but this has been my go to for a couple years now I wouldnt say that it necessarily does very much for masking my redness I have Rosacea but it definitely evens out moisturizes and provides a nice barrier for my skin I like having this barrier between my skin and my makeup so I dont irritate my already sensitive skin any further with makeup I will never not have this product in my makeup bag,I have oily skin and this primer works perfect for me I apply using finger tips and leave to set before applying my foundation My makeup application feels so much easier and smoother to blend when using this product,very smooth helps spread makeup evenly I have very sensitive skin and there has been obsoletely no skin reaction,I really liked this primer It really helped diminish pores and fine lines Its not the best primer Ive used But its no where near the worst,Makes your skin super smooth  allows you to blend foundation easily,Love this green primer I have rosacea and this really helps hide the red while giving my skins a smooth shine free look Much cheaper than other brands and works better,Flawless,Great stuff good price Came quickly,I love this primer It goes on super soft and doesnt look green at all when its rubbed in Im not sure how well it does to offset redness but its still a great primer,I have been using this primer and have found it to be the best for me over the very pricy options My makeup goes on flawlessly and stays beautifulI still have the pricey ones sitting in my drawer,Goes on so smooth and last all day,Bought this as my first experience with primer and I would never go back to my days without it You dont need to use much to tell the difference I bought this estimating about  months ago and its still not out I also dont wear make up everyday though']"

       "['It was almost oily feeling and didnt leave the green base to cover up my redness like I was expecting Not impressed with this at all Ive bought Nyx green in the past for my redness and it was awesome so not sure what happened with this one,Waste of money Threw in the garbage Way too sheer and the green did not work at all,Waaaay too small for the price and not really that good of a primer either,Pretty sure this product is not authentic or its expired The product separates a lot and seems really oily It also does NOTHING for redness,I previously got another green primer from NYX and I loved it It was so creamy and really reduced my redness However the consistency for this primer is off its more matte which is ok I was just surprised in comparison to my last NYX primer and it doesnt reduce my redness as much as my last primer did As for keeping my makeup on which is the goal for most primers I feel like it doesnt do much,Did not mask any redness on my face Its more of a regular primer not a redness cover up Absolutely useless for me,Im very disappointed in this because it is not the same product as in the tubes with the wands It is watery and then feels greasy and my skin is still showing red and dark circles,Very disappointed Didnt help reduce redness at all,It doesnt work,It feels Cakey and doesnt look natural under my liquid foundation,Feels greasy,I wanted to like this affordable product so much especially with all the good reviews But I felt like it broke my face out I dont like the way it feels either Im bummed about this purchase,Made my skin breakout,Pretty sure this isnt the same product I usually buy Ive usedthis product for years to mix into foundations that are too yellow for my very fair skin tone the formula is not the same at all,Terrible primer Doesnot fill pores for smooth look,I liked it and used it but it caused my skin to break out When I stopped using it my skin was healthier no pimples Maybe it just didnt work well on my skin,Dont recommend this,I purchased this product to cover broken veins and to conceal my big pores It didnt do either Total waste of money,Terrible quality This is runnyoily doesnt show up no concealingpriming or green color and has an unpleasant odor I used it once and immediately washed it off A color correcting crayon though very dry is a better choice,I think this may have been a counterfeit productIt was very thin nearly watery and it did not hide or cover red in any way The product normally works which I why I wonder if it is fakebut the packaging looked real I threw it outcomplete waste of money,Doesnt really accomplish what I purchased it for Too thin Also the sizeamount is a bit less than as advertised,Your browser does not support HTML videoLooks like old product,I ordered the green one and I bought this to cover my redness but this works the same as the clear one I was expecting this to be thicker paste so it could color correct the red but it did no covering Its a nice primer if you have nothing to cover but this is supposed to cover redness so Im giving it one star Save your money if you actually need a color corrector,I wanted to find something not as expensive but clearly you get what you pay for No good smell I cant tell if it changes my skin tone The only good thing is the silky smooth feel I will not purchase again,Dont waste your money honestly,Cheap products,Makes my foundation flake off Feels super oily,This product does nothing for redness It basically goes on clear It also is a terrible primer This product is greasy and my makeup slides off my face when I try to apply it over this primer If you want something redness reducing I suggest ErborianCC Color Correcting  Redness Reducing Broad Spectrum SPF  Its more expensive but it actually does reduce redness,Doesnt spread as easy as other related products,Does nothing to cover rednessNothing but an oily lotion,Its not good at all A waist of money,It doesnt even cover any of my redness Its more of a moisturizer,While this primer makes my skin feel silky smooth it does little if anything to correct the redness in my face,I got this product to help with my pores and it seemed like it enhanced my pores more then anything I tried with and without moisturizer first Ive tried a different foundation and kept getting the same results Does not work Would not recommend,My face has a lot of redness so I had high hopes that this green primer would help diffuse the redness a bit It did not Not at all However it does work good as a primer,I have red skinI bought this to tone under my makeupIt is too sheerhelps only a littleBut not worth it,This is not a cover up or corrector its an oily green tinted lotion that doesnt do anything but make skin feel greasy,Oily runny doesnt do anything for redness Complete waste of money,if youre looking for a moisturizing product likely look elsewhere this is an extremely thick and slick solution that immediately caused my face to feel tight and my foundation lasts longer without this product,Greasy Doesnt do anything,When I first opened the product it was great but after about a week of not using it all the oil has separated and wont mix with the rest of the product anymore I tried shaking it and putting it in my beauty fridge but its no use,This does not do what it is advertised asIt does not remove any redness at all,I LOVE anything NYX and Im so disappointed by this It makes my concealer get goopy and clumpy around my nose Wouldnt recommend it,Doesnt work like at all Face is just as red And its REALLY greasy Save your money,Completely useless against redness Granted I think I have more redness than someone with darker skin tones Im very pale but there was literally NO difference when I put this on one side of my face to compare with the side without product Also a very nasty greasy feeling Makes it difficult for liquid foundation to go on top of it Very disappointed,Item is old Does not matter how often or how hard I shake the bottle it does not mix When I try to squeeze some out it is just oilIt has absolutely no coverage,I got the green primer for redness color correction It does nothing  absolutely nothing  to correct the red It also feels like Im covering my face in cooking grease Lovely,Whomever said this primer is the best is dead wrong This is the absolute worst It does nothing but moisturize my skin a little Does not help with redness Does not help foundation last longer Does not help with anything I do not recommend this to anyone If you want an inexpensive primer use Hard Candy brand primer,If you are looking for a primer this one is greatIf you are looking to have your Rosacea covered this does nothing to cover the redness,This product is a waste of money at any priceProvides absolutely NO coverage of red or bruised areas under coverup or body makeup Dont waste your money,This product does not work at allIts fake news and snake oil,It smells bad and looks very fake,It doesnt really apply well,Its not the best as stated,This product doesnt work at all It is greasy doesnt absorb and most importantly doesnt help with redness There are great products out there but they are much MUCH more expensive Unfortunately,Someone took pkg and I need photo of item and all info so I can collect Do you have cs phone  I am  and need help  pkgs taken the nd was the pink tubeMalley which was delivered I need someone to help me collect for them Please connect me with help Thx,I thought I would try this since it is cheaper than the product I usually use smashbox but it is not even close to providing the coverage than smashbox doesIt just makes the skin very oily and the foundation looks shiny after applying over this primer,I bought this because of the reviews but honestly was not impressed I dont know if it was the batch that I got but it was really oily and the texture was just off,I was very excited to use this primer because it has tons of great reviews however Im not a fan It does go on smooth and gives your face a silky feel so thats great but it did nothing when it came to redness My cheeks have a natural red tint and throughout the day my foundation wears off and reveals it I thought this green primer would fix it but it did not,If youre looking for a product to cover redness even a little bit this is NOT the product for you It doesnt cover any redness or dark marks,Saved money but it wasnt worth it Going back to Laura Geller Spackle,This stuff is like greencolored grease or somethingDoes nothing to combat redness and leaves a dreadful greasy residueTruly terrible,This was not very green and did not control or cover redness like advertised,Breaks my skin out Also when applying my foundation it wasnt easy applying it because it felt as if I was wearing a mask If you have oily skin it doesnt work At least not with me,Doesnt have staying power Makes my skin oily after a while,I bought this because it was cheap and a larger size than my normal Elf Product Alas I will go back to Elf  The Elf primer causes my makeup to distribute easily across my skin but this primer does not Two stars bc its better than no primer at all,Does not cover the redness,I suspect this was counterfeitIt was greasy chemicalsmelling the packaging didnt match the official NYX websiteand it didnt seem like the same level of quality of packaging or product that NYX usually hasIt was also underpricedI returned itI opened it and couldnt stand the smell and was disgusted by the oozy grease leaking out when I got ready to use it,It comes off after  min So when I rub my face to put concealer or foundation after primer it just peels off like dead skin,Nice coverage under foundation but clogs pores and caused breakouts Would not recommend,I have finally pinned down that this primer is what Im allergic to while Im doing my makeup Its nothing severe although it does seem like it gets worse with each use Now that I have discovered its the primer it went straight in the garbage I never had issues with the product when I purchased at the store so Im assuming this one is fake and there is an ingredient in it that shouldnt be,Caused me to break out My skin was very angry after using this,Dont buy,Wouldnt use again,It was a clear wet gel that took forever to dry and didnt seem to do anything,For some reason my eyes start watering when I wear thisIt might not bother others,Really thin and oily My foundation just slid around on this primer It didnt do anything for my redness either,The packaging is great and easy to use Didnt make my makeup last longer or help cover my acne,Not a good primer at all,Very oily product Made me break out,Not happy gives a sensation of silk,This product is fake see the original photo On Amazon,Very oilyDid not cover rosacea,it comes out almost clear so does nothing for your redness on your face I even did it on only one side of my face to see if it made any difference but did NOTHING it comes out so clear almost as if nothing was there A clear green tinged cream,This product did absolutely nothing to prime my skin,Did not make a difference in my red complexion I am not a fan,Didntdo as advertised,Was not very thick so it didnt seem to mask redness like I figured it could,Dont buy this product as it is fake When comparing packaging and ingredients listed and shown directly on the NYX website this product does not match The super low price less than  compared to around  at Walmart should have been a red flag The packaging looks so close you would never know unless you looked closely but it is missing trademark symbols has text that is difficult to read and the ingredients dont quite match those listed on the NYX website I read some other more buried reviews that also reported this being a counterfeit dupe Lesson learned Im just glad I didnt put the product on my facewho knows what is in it,Maybe it was just my face but this primer made my skin look pale and ashy I also did not the way it felt on my face,Im  or  inches from my mirror and I cant tell that the product has done anything Theres virtually no difference before and after I put it on Really angers me when I feel like I completely wasted my money,This product did zero to tone down natural red undertones I found another one that I could try before I buy that actually worked a miracle Dont waste your money This will do nothing to calm down redness however it does have a silky feel and Im going to use it until its gone because I HATE to throw away money,I used this spray primer as directed but it made it very difficult to apply my foundationWhen I finally got it on it was very uneven and cakey It looked terrible I must be doing something wrong because it didnt do anything for me that all the videos Ive watched promised Ill just go back to using my foundation on top of my moisturizer and skip the primer,This never showed up and it stank a lotThose girls were born into a good life,Not really impressed It felt soft and went on smoothly but it definitely did not decrease the appearance of pores or fine lines at all In fact it did the complete opposite My face looks more leathery and texturey with this mess on I wont be purchasing again and do recommend spending a little extra for a good primer,Terrible product Did not cover any redness whatsoever the consistency is very watery In fact it made my skin even more red Dont waste your time and money in this product,I got this because the reviews made it sound promising but I wish I hadnt wasted the money My foundationconcealer still cracked and looked awful when I was wearing it I tried it a bunch of ways to see if it was just one thing I tried withwithout applying mousterizer I tried it with just foundation tried it with just concealer tried it withwithout finishing spray Didnt work no matter what,The stuff feels sticky but when you apply it has not primer effect other than drying out the skin If I were you would save the money and not get it,The green tint does absolutely nothing I would recommend LA Girls green concealer over this product by a mile if youre trying to hide redness or counter warmth in your foundation,This primer is heavy Even if I waited a while before applying foundation and used the softest foundation application brush this primer does not stand up or layer well,This product didnt improve the tone of my skin at all Made no difference,Not for me,This primer is horrible Greasy and does not cover anything Do not recommend and would send back if I could,I didnt like this primer and it didnt like me back I dont think it did anything,the green tint in this primer is supposed to counter a ruddy complexion but the product instantly turned my face seriously redwherever I used it immediately went dark red and I was very relieved when it returned to normal blotchy red after I washed it offback to square one,When I put it on it felt good on my face however after applying foundation it caused my face to flake Strange,Did It work for me at all Was using product to off set the red in my faceAlso so slippery I was so hoping it would help,I used this product for several weeks to reduce redness on my skin but I unfortunately me at saw a change,made me light,This did not help reduce or even the tone on my skin at all Perhaps if someone had very good coloring with occasional splotches but not at all for uneven skin tone,This does not negate red color in face Total waste of money,This made my skin more oily and only lasted part of the the day,The bottle was half full,Not good primer,Very thin Did not cover skin redness,Doesnt neutralize redness as well as I had hoped,I tried this product after using a different brand more recently This product is very greasy and I received no added longevity of my makeup Going back to my old brand,I would not recommend This is not a dupe for smash box as I had hoped,Gummed up immediately Not ideal for layerering you foundation,This is not the real product It does nothing for color correcting at all Feels so greasy and horrible When i took it off at the end of the day my red cheeks and neck i have roscea those the need for color correcting was redder and splotchier then it normally is,This mask is too thin to workI tried putting on two coats and it still tears off in schards too thin to workI wont buy again,I normally use Colorescience All Calm and I LOVE the product  it feels great on my skin greatly reduces the redness and has SPF I decided to look around for another redness reducer that is friendlier to the wallet but this product is NOT the solutionAs a primer it is simply OK  it glides on well but feels more like a gel similar to a product Ive used in the pastPerhaps it simply doesnt work well with my liquid foundation but the mix is horribleOnly after I add the powder can I step out in publicAs a redness reducer it does not work at allFAILOverall extremely disappointed in this product,Not at all matte  does nothing for my skin The green is clear and no less shine,I really wanted to like this product I loved the feel of it on my skin right after I applied it Then I put some concealer over it and it was like it rubbed off Like silicone glue I would use it when Im not wearing any facial makeup,This did absolutely nothing to help with redness or discoloration or as a primer Cant believe it got any good reviewsJust happened to pick up Cover girl green primer while I was at CVS and it works great,Sadly contained leaked some of the liquid during shipment  container was covered on it Sis not have time to return,This product does feel smooth on my skin but does nothing to cover the redness Will not purchase again,Im not a huge fan of primers as most seem to make me breakout but this did not I didnt notice a big difference in using this product compared to no primer so I dont think I would purchase it again,I wanted to love this after reading so many of the positive reviews on it and I liked that it was crueltyfree but I was highly disappointedFrom the first use this primer left my entire face feeling greasy and disgusting as if I hadnt washed my face in a week I endured it for a couple of uses knowing my face tends to have dry skin from time to time Even with moisturizer and using it for a month the feeling did not change or improve And it also did not help with smoothing fine lines and pores in my skin  I felt like it made them more apparent actuallySo while this primer may not be for me It might work for you Everyone has different skin and things can feel different from person to person But this is not a good primer if you have dry skin from my experience If dry skin isnt an issue for you I say give it a shot and see if you like it Its the only way youll really know,The quality is REPULSIVE Do not waste your money this looks and feels cheap like something from the dollar store and doesnt work well at all I think it made me break out a little also If I could give zero stars I would,I was hoping this was a good dupe for my smashbox photo finish but it wasnt When you use it it starts to clump and come off in rubbery pieces Stopped using it  LOVE THIS BRAND but this product just didnt work for me,There are far better similarly priced primers out there ELF is really good,Product arrived in a sandwich bag looked at tube its so old I could not read any of the printing or faded away in spots Cant use this not sure if expired or if its what I ordered,Asco de producto me saco espinillas,Made my face dry and flaky,This is the worst primer I have ever used Makeup looked very caked on after a few hours of wear and also gave me an orange glow after a couple hours,Muy poco producto,I thought it was very thin and didnt really cover the red like it says,I was really looking forward to this product and was quite disappointed when it arrived and I found out hell runny and watery it wasIts more like goop than it is a sicker foundation type productsIt barely has any green collor and does not cover red at allFor me it is completely useless Disappointing,This primer is not for oily skin I have never had a problem with my make up rubbing off but with this stuff I couldnt even touch my face slightly without my makeup rubbing off And rather I touched my nose or not the make up would be off after about five hours I just stopped using it today and my make up was flawless and stayed all day It also takes a lot of product to cover the face,Not a fan I love this brands product however this product is super oily and watery Not at all what I expected I will pay more and buy a better product,Very very light and once blended in you cant see any difference It is also very greasy,Some days its gloopy some days its really liquidy and nasty I heard this product is good Im disappointed,Broke my skin out in just one use,Left my complexion oily,Doesnt work dont buy,This does absolutely nothing for me Its a clear gel and doesnt fill or cover or anything I might as well have put water on my face Ill stick with my Benefit primer,EXTREMELY oily for skin,Had previously purchased NYX Studio Perfect Primer Green from a local store and liked the product When I ran out I purchased this product from Amazon in June The packaging and formula from the Amazon product differed from what I purchased in sore The Amazon version was oily and goopy the writing on the packaging was faint and difficult to read In the photo left is store bought right Amazon boughtIn terms of the product itself purchased from the store I like the feel of it and it does a good job providing a smooth surface on which to apply my foundationAlthough the product claims to color correct I have seen no redness reduction in my skin when I use the product I will repurchase in store,I bought this in green to correct red spots This product doesnt do much of anythingIt disappears immediately after dabbing it onto my skin Before I even get a chance to blotblend its gone Ive tried applying larger amounts even excessive amounts and it still doesnt conceal any redness I always shake before use but it always seems to squirt out separated half green and half liquid,Very oily,This does not work well on my face it felt like an oil slick after putting makeup on However somehow I started putting it on my feet It made them feel really smooth and not sweaty ,Ill stick with the more expensive brandsThis one does not help much with keeping the shine down,I did not like this product at all It was a waste of my money It leftmy face with like this white clear peel it never even was able to spreadhow it should,Like others I had the issues of this product only functioning as a primer There was no redness reduction I even applied the primer to half my face and waited a few hours to compare Sadly no difference,I though this would help cover the redness of the face but it doesnt it is just a regular primer that looks green but it does not cover the red areas of the face as expected,Product was very oily separated and smeary I sent it back,DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER THIS IS A KNOCK OFF AND NOT THE REAL ITEM PICTURED I just received mine and it is not whats in the picture You can see the label difference in my pictures and the product feels totally different than the real thing,Greasy and does not cover at all Complete crap,I received a FAKE I didnt even notice at firstbut then my skin started turning red and blotchy When I inspected the packaging I noticed that the one I received looks different than advertised by the seller as well as the NYX website Upon even further inspection I found spelling errors on the front and back Come on guys I dont even know what this garbage is made of and I feel disgusted having put it on my skin ,Had poor consistency and did not apply well,Didnt provide good coverage or balance to my face,Did absolutely nothing,Horrible oily and very runny consistency Will not buy again,Product does not work to blend and correct skin toneTry another option',\n",

time yesterday and it made my make up go on so easily I love it,Very silky to the touch and makes my skin appear very smooth,bought this as a piece of a starter kit for make up would recommend to those who are looking to learn how to do makeup but dont want to spend a lot of money upfront,I usually mix this with my foundation and it makes it super light on my skin The primer itself is very light on the skin as well It makes your face very smooth even with just little product  would recommend ,This product is everything it claims to be Love it,Just got it today LOVE IT Works so well and my makeup looked great all day all night,Ive always used this brand of primer Many different types in this brand Good pricing too,This stuff minimizes wrinklesFeels so soft I love it,I finally got to open it up and try it I loved it Highly recommend,This primer is awesome Its smooth and does the job Also moisturizes,I dont know much about makeup but this was recommended and I am so happy with it I absolutely love it and will never wear my makeup without it again,The primer was super easy to apply I used my fingers as I feel like that would be the best application as it feels like a more siliconebased primer I used it with my stick foundation and it was great EXCEPT near my nose area oddly When I applied my foundation the foundation wouldnt adhere properly and looked like it was cracking and dry Which didnt make sense to me I think you should proceed with caution if you use a stick foundation but if you use a liquid style foundation I feel like there would not be as many bad interactions,It works Makeup comes out looking flawless,Love this primer Great price and same quality as my high end make up primers Definitely recommend,Great primer I was very hesitant at first bc Im used to high end products but this surprised me in a great way If u have any redness on ur skin as I do sometimes this primer works wondersUnbelievable shipping received product earlier than I had expectedThank u so much,Great primer for great price I have been using Estee Lauder or Laura Gellar for years which are both around  This NYX works just as good nice smooth finish to apply foundation I really dont see a difference especially since I only paid  Granted the others are  oz tubes and this is  oz but still would be half the price Is sold,I do not notice a difference in how my foundation applies with this Oh well,Ive never used a primer and I love this stuff,Love how it goes on,I switched to this from the Smashbox original Photo Finish primer which was my holy grail primer in terms of functionality but unfortunately would break me out if I used it too frequently I really like that this NYX version has a more stripped down ingredients list that is a lot more friendly to sensitive skinAt the same time this primer isnt quite as good It provides a very smooth silky canvas and smoothes over texture well but it is a lot less oilcontrolling This is a great choice for dry or combodry skin but less so for oily or combooily,Oh my goodness the tiniest bit makes my skin so soft  its like magicIt did not work for my waterbased foundation though  took some research to realize the oilwater issue is why it was clumping up immediatelyI still use it when Im not rocking foundation like a just highlighter day though and I love it,LOVED IT,Ive been wearing foundation without a primer every day for  yearsI never thought I needed one until I tried thisI have missed out on so muchIt makes my makeup application look so smooth and lasts into late eveningUsually by the end of the day I look washed out because my foundation lasts only  hoursNow I look fresh faced all dayI decided on using primer with the hopes of preventing my foundation from rubbing off onto my covid face maskIt does minimize rub off but I still see mask lines on my cheeks and foundation on my maskI used too much primer one day under my mask and my skin ended up looking chalky and awfulIm thinking about trying out a  hour foundation with this primer,Skin type oily and sensitiveTone warmColor mediumlight pralineMy skin is oily and I also use a sunscreen that adds a little more shine I hoped to use this without makeup in order to matteify my skin It reduces shine a lot but only for a short while About an hour later my skin was shiny again The antiredness effect is subtle but it workstldr great as a primer with makeup but not longlasting enough for allday shine control,My first time using a primer and I gotta day I noticed a huge difference Foundation went on much smoother makeup stayed on longer and I usually get oily by the end of the day but with this product I can say I look  less oily This product has definitely changed my game,Great size for price,Does great,I debated whether I should put three stars or four Its an excellent primer so four it is Better than most primers Ive used in the past However as a redness concealer Im disappointed It doesnt make a difference on my rosacea whatsoeverOverall Ive become a big fan of NYXs products in general,I have used this product for two years now and cant live without itIt is perfect for those with oily or combination skin as it just smooths the skinIf you dont feel like wearing foundation this is a nice alternative However when wearing foundation this is sort of like an amazing clear spackle for ones faceHighly recommend,A little goes a long way Ive used baby skin primer and had to use a decent amount and then my skin was left feeling greasy This NYX primer is extremely lightweight even if you were to accidentally use more than usual Its quick to dry and does the job to hide pores and linesWill definitely be buying again,Pro  Goes on easily  smoothly is nicely sheer other makeup Eg blush goes on like a glove no scent Con  Would like if came in a larger size,Gives me a smooth finish,Great primer no scent and doesnt clog pores I have cystic acne and sensitive skin and it does not effect that I prefer a matte look verse shiny and this does the job,Me encanto,Love this product So light and smoothing,I really enjoy this primer I have fine lines and dry skin and was looking for something silicone based to help fill in my fine lines and work well with all the moisturizer I have on my face I love the silky texture of this product truly feels incredible on the skin lightweight helped with moisturizing and best part was that it DID help to fill in my fine lines especially near my eyes so my makeup looked much much more flawless and smooth I highly recommend,Product glides on great gives me a smooth finish Filla in most pores and lines just not he deep set ones in the forehead Will definitely keep buying,Great product,Gave as a gift,Have never used a base product so I didnt know what to expect Surprised by how wonderful it made my base look Less flaws and pores showing on my face,Wonderful product I hadnt used toner before but it made a good deal of difference for me,I really like this It seems to blur very slightly and makes my skin look softer and a little younger who wouldnt want that I dont even bother with foundation anymore I simply use a good moisturizer I recommend Jason Natural Cosmetics Vitamin E cream and this product Just be sure to let your moisturizer dry well before applying this over it Apply sparingly as a little goes a long way,This really helped to firm  tighten my skin while covering flaws and I have many Great coverage with finer lines and smoothed out my skin It lays well under makeup Leaves your face feeling soft I recommend,Doesnt have a sent Which is good I will use this if I run out of my favorite kind I love Farmasi brand It glides on smoothly This one not as slick But still a good primer,I love this product it never disappoints me and I will continue to buy it on Amazon,Perfect Does exactly what it says and doesnt break me out LOVE,This went on smoothly covering fine lines  making a smooth surface for the rest of my makeup especially that pesky undereye area,This is so good It goes on easily and leaves a silky texture My skin feels smooth and less red It evens my skin tone and makes applying makeup much easier,Good,Good stuff,Awesome,My favourite one,Great product last long The smell is a little off but its still worth the buy,This stuff works so good Im having trouble with my make up coming off on my nose no matter what I use Im in Texas so Im ALWAYS sweating and Im pregnant Today I used it for the first time and none of my make up came off with my sweat,My go to As good as MAC,I love this product,Best primer I have ever used,NYX products as long as they are discounted appropriately are good products There is a tendency for some to over price but I would only buy products that are cheaper than those at the cosmetic stores,Exactly what I was looking for,Just as good if not better than Smashbox primer for three times the costWont buy expensive primers anymoreNYC has nice quality makeup,It is literally skin blurring and does the job I pair this with NYX Matte setting spray for a beautiful finish,I like it makes makeup last way longer,I love this product It is amazing I love how it feels,I really like this primer A little goes a long way and makes my face feel really soft and smooth The price is really good too,So buttery smooth on my face No irritation really helps the rest of my makeup stay on through out the day Good amount of product for the price Would buy again,It was great Will order again,I love how smooth and quickly it works to minimize shine Its not going to mattify your face like a highend primer but it works well enough for daily use and i will be buying more I use it as part of my daily sunscreen routine and it leaves my face looking fresh and hydrated I dont know how long it lasts since I just use it to get me through short distances in the sun but will be updating on that later,I like how soft it makes my skin and blends my makeup well,Great product for the price,This is a great primer As soon I put it on it felt so smooth It is silicone based but it was very blurring and didnt settle into any fine lines or cracks It wore well and I enjoy it,NYX Primer is a great productI have been spending  on a different primer for the same size bottleI will continue using this product,The primer does its job its smooth and a whitish clear color scent free and is a over all great product I have to add a little drip of lotion to it as it dies not have any moisturizing properties to it After application with out using the lotion my skin began to peel n dry out around eye and brow area As well as deying out my nose and causing pealing With added lotion this does not happen at all I love NYX,Helps cover up redness Love this product Will definitely buy again,This by far is the best primer Ive used I tried a couple but this takes the crown Will definitely buy again,I am dedicated to this product I buy it every month I have very sensitive acne prone skin and this is the only color correcting primer Ive been able to use It hides redness beautifully and its very lightweight,Doesnt really cover red like I had expected it to but it doubles as a great primer Great price,I like it Definitely cheaper than the  SBox brand Works great to make my pores smaller,I have been looking for a Smashbox dupe and this is the closest I have found I get nervous ordering makeup and hair products on Amazon but I felt it was the real product because it was packaged well Regardless I like it and the price is way better than Smashbox Seems to be moisturizing as well So if you have drier skin this is a nice product,Creates a nice blur effect for skin flaws I wear it under my foundation Its like a primer and helps smooth out the foundation Arrived on time,This primer does exactly as described I like to look cute on a budget so this is now my new go to primer My makeup looks flawless My concealer would crease under my eyes over time Not anymore Im completely satisfied with this product,Yea,I use this daily and my skin looks and feels better my makeup lasts longer and my face is easier to clean at night,I always revert back to this Ive used MAC Tarte Too face and thousands of dollars of other primers and I always go right back to NYX Its lightweight and moisturizing and not oily,Good It has a little water on it,Amazing product for the price Similar to more expensive primers Has a great texture doesnt make my face oily and helps my makeup go on smooth and last the day,I have bought two bottles of this already You dont need alot to make it work It covers and smooths the face very nicely,Works very well,Its decent and I would buy again,Its pretty good,Keydown and other events to Fire,Makes my face feel like silk I use it even when not using foundation,Im so accustomed to using high end primer because I thought those were the only ones that worked Due to this quarantine I decided to look one up on amazon and stumbled upon this oneThis product is amazing It makes your skin incredibly soft Softer than the porefessional from benefit I have combination skin more on the oily side and my make up holds up very well I make sure I blot my skin of course but I noticed getting oily much later in the day I totally recommend,Works great,If you have an oily skin dont get this It leaves my face really oily and makes my makeup look shiny after a short while Not recommended at all,It works well and feels nice,No scent but really good primer Very moisturizing and spreadable,Love this Primer Seriously a must have in your makeup collection Cant believe I waited so long to try it Skin looks flawless and Makeup goes on smooth AND makeup stays in place especially paired with a great setting powder,Great product great seller,I like this product because it made your make up go on smoother,Used for years  tried other primers that work very well also  but despite its cheaper price tag  it absolutely works very wellWill always keep in my makeup bag for travel applicationEasy to use  glides on skin  works very well under my color corrector and concealer and eye lids for eyeshadow application and longevityLasts easily  hours for me without touch up  sometimes ,Very good primer,I have skin with a lot of pink undertones Therefore its necessary for me to use a green primer to look my best And since Im out among the public singing very often its necessary for me to look my best and take care of my skin This primer gets rid of the excessive pink undertones in my skin and allows me to use tinted moisturizer instead of foundation unless of course Im going to be on stage and then stage makeup is necessary This primer glides on nicely and evenly It isnt too thick but it does cover the pink and evens out my skin tone Its pretty creamy so a little goes a long way making this a good bang for your buck I have dry skin so I use a lot of moisturizing products and I find this primer is moisturizing as well I can recommend this highly to anyone who has pink undertones they want to tone down If you have yellow undertones this is the wrong primer for you Everyone is different but I find this lasts all day for me If I apply it at  am it and my tinted moisturizer will still look fine at  or  pm especially if I use the setting spray made by the same company Highly recommended to all who have excessive pink undertones in their skin and want to eliminate them,This works almost as well as the Smashbox primerIt does lack a little longevity but for the price difference it is totally worth it to me,Perfect,Great stuff just as good as more expensive brands Kept my makeup on all day and felt less greasy,I like the texture of the product,I tried this since it had decent reviews and was so cheap

my crazyoily skin would EVER go away omg where was this stuff  years ago Makes my skin feel like silk and almost NO OIL I may have to do just a touch of powder around pm but thats it I also tried NYXs Shine Killer and they were very close but I think this  lasts a little longer it doesnt smell great but the smell goes away VERY quickly,Great coverage Works great,For the price this is a very good primer I use it everyday,my makeup goes on smooth  keeps it on all day my skin doesnt look as try with foundation on as long as i use this first i dont know if the green really does anything to help

appearing oilyI was pleased with this product,The face is really smooth after use,Good product,This is the only primer I use I find other brands are chalky and as an African American woman chalky

goes well under my IT cosmetic cc hydrating serum The primer creates somewhat Matte effect and is perfect for my oily skin,Best primer I have ever used,I wear Estee Lauder foundation and this NYX primer seems to work well togetherIm hoping it will keep working well into the hot summers here in AZ so well see,Never used a primer like this before The silky texture us great and my previously hard to blend foundation smoothed right over Im so sold on NYX I just ordered  concealers to test out,Very happy with this,good Mette finish,Was having issues with my foundation not staying all day Paid for a makeup consultant a friend to do my makeup for a girls night out He used this product so after a night out my make still looked great I will only used this product after that and it works to prime my face and make my foundation last longer,Love this  keeps my beat fresh for hours,I adore this product I still try other primers on occasion but I always come back to this one,I am so shocked at how amazing this primer is For the last three years I have bought so many expensive high end primers trying to find the holy grail  this is it and at an unbeatable price,A little went a long way I purchased  tubes and I just finished a tube of this after using daily for over  months After reading reviews I use less than a dimesize amount and mix it with a tinted beauty balm to smooth out my complexion Very light weight and no odor Wears well for me,Skin will look flawless,This primer and I totally recommend this to any girllady that wants a great feeling primer It goes on clear is silky

and makes your makeup look better,Love it,Great product for an affordable price Plus it goes on so smoooooth,This product is easy to apply and makes my face so soft I dont know how much it helps with color correction but its a great primer My foundation goes on smoothly over it I already ordered a second bottle,I use this everyday and am very happy I have another expensive brand that I use for special occasions This product is very good for the price,Great to smooth,I liked,Good product,This doesnt colorcorrect I would say it is OK for a primer for this price Green becomes translucent immediately,Okay so I bought this because I ran out of my other color correcting primer This doesnt really color correct like it intends too Infact if I were to just wear this Id still be pretty pink BUT Ive found Ive I put it in a thicker layer all over my face it blurs my pores like no other AND helps make my foundation more opaque If youre planning on using this on its own to color correct and tone down redness without foundation I cant recommend it But If you are planning on using it as a primer and then following it up with foundation as it is intended you cant go wrong Just make sure youre applying liberally Also this in combo with the nyx matte setting spray Absolutely magical full coverage and lasts allllll day,Makes such a huge difference in how your make up comes out and lasts

go to makeup products,A clear primer is important to me as a whiteopaque primer changes the color of your skinI dont put foundation on my whole face so a clear primer allows to prime my whole face and only apply foundation where I need it on the trouble spots,Keeps my makeup on all day However elf is  for theyre primer and Ill definitely be moving to that,It make skin smooth A very nice product I would recommend to buy,Just what I ordered,Works great covering my redness,Bought as a gift for my mother Really good product and great brand for a fair price,I was completely blown away by the

moisturizerPrimer is preferably unscentedMakeup base goes on smoothlyDoes not pill after applicationNYX not only meets my criteria it exceeds them I normally apply moisturizer after showering allowing

like everything about this primer It goes on smooth keeps my makeup smooth and the biggy is it makes fine lines practically disappear I will be ordering again,Goes on smoothly and feels quite nice Lasts all day It covers general redness but any blatant splotchiness will not be covered I have quite a few of those and will go over them with an additional green concealer stick and also a red concealer for darker spots The NYX green primer does contribute along with the concealer sticks to toning those trouble spots down more so that they are not so obvious than just using the concealer sticks alone I am very happy with this purchase Great product More so after having learned that NYX is crueltyfree On the other hand I am on the fence as to whether I will continue to purchase this I understand LOreal the parent company of NYX is not crueltyfree So debating whether purchasing NYX products would be the same as continuing to purchase products that are animaltested I would like to try and steer away from that now,Great product for the cost,Q llego puntual,It does the job and helps my makeup last longer,Good working for me,One of my all time favorite brands and favorite primers,Love this product,Love this primer It is silky and smooth perfect base for a cream or liquid foundation and very affordable Great product for the price I dont use it for the redness reduction

and I feel like this works just as well I also love the fact that it has the color correcter built in I get two products in one Outstanding,LADIES if youre looking for a primer look no further This primer is THEE BEST Ive tried Setting powder It showed up every tiny little crease and wrinkle Especially under my eyes Who wants that PLUS when I applied my mascaradidnt matter if I waited about  minutes before applying foundation or used many many different mascaras my mascara would leave little black spots under my eyes Little mascara tracks Raccoon eyes I could walk in a store and see myself and BAM A Raccoon starting back at me  NYX STUDIO PERFECT is just that  PERFECT  NO mascara tracks No Raccoon eyesIve waited a few days to write this review so I could use different mascaras thinking either I found the PERFECT product or is just a combination of NYX and certain mascara NOPE Its NYX for sure I can even nap with a full face of makeup on and wake up and look like its freshly put on PLUS it doesnt accentuate any small lines under my eyesIf youre hesitating just get this miracle in the black bottle Youll be very happy as I amPs Im going to visit my bf for three months and Im buying enough bottles to hold me over Not sure if his country carries this Sure as hell not taking any chanceS,Great base Love it,I used to buy Smashboxs primers till I read an article that this NYX was basically the sameFor a few bucks I figured why not try itMy  year old niece and myself have never paid for expensive primer sinceI cant say the same for other similar items like mascara I always spend the extraIn this case though it was worth it,I dont know much about primer or make up but this keeps my eye makeup on all day long,So heres the thing in terms of giving you a smooth start and helping makeup stay on your face longer this primer is excellent If it was marketed as just your standard primer Id give it  stars However there was no color correcting effect from the green It did not in any way diminish the red undertones in my skin,This brand is highly rated on Google so I thought Id give it a tryit smooths and evens out my skin before applying Bare Minerals makeuphave worn without makeup for casual days and my look is still smooth  pulled together I have combo skin and this primer works well for me,Works like a charm makeup application better,Worked as expected,Pretty decent primer,Easy to use,for sure a better value dupe for the smashbox primer keeps my skin looking smooth under my makeup not greasyshiny great texture,primer before foundation,So silky soft with makeup or without,Was recommended to me as a makeup primer and it feels nice on skin very silky,Covered pores Made my makeup look even better,Helps to tone and brighten but w a matte finishbut wo drying out my skin  Im going to try the green next bc Ive developed rosaceafun,You can never go wrong with NYXThis primer is like a pore filler and primer in one Absolutely great primer Goes on silky and has a great staying powerGive it a shot and youll always keep this on your makeup bag I do,Makes my face feel like silk before application of foundation I work long hours and it def helps to keep my face in place It does have an oily base but does come out pretty dang smooth One of my fave inexpensive primers,Great for oily skin My makeup goes on smooth and stays all day,First of all WOW I have tried dozens of primers in my life Wasted well over  dollars on primers that didnt work or didnt last NYX seemed to be everyones secret weapon so I decided ro give it a whirl Its notably a lot cheaper than most other primers Ive tried so I was skeptical but I am HOOKED on this stuff I have a combinationoily face and its hard to get makeup that will stay put all day without looking patchy or sliding around but this primer works miracles My large pores around my tzone are hard to smooth out but this just glides over them and makes it so easy to apply my medium coverage

in the morning til  when I take it all off Seriously a holy grail,Super soft on face and helps foundation glide right on,The product arrived quickly and appears to be a good valueIt goes on smooth and wears well My only complaint is that it doesnt work well with my favorite concealer causing some cakingand leaving me to need either a different concealer or a different primerWhen using the primer without concealer Ive been very pleased It does not irritate my skin or cause breakouts My skin actually looks better with a light priming and setting powder I will buy again,Been using this for years

that its perfect feels light and isnt sticky,Excelente servicio,I used to use the photofinish primer by smashbox and loved it I found that the NYX studio is a perfect replacement for quarter of the price Highly recommend,Great product,Omg this is FABULOUS skin is silk with this product,I have super oily Indian skin so most of the time my makeup starts to fade after a few hours This primer works so well Only a drop is needed to cover most of the face and does not look shiny at all Makeup lasts wayyyy longer now,Love it,I can really tell a diff with my foundation when I dont use the primerI

not stop making it,This primer is a clear lightweight gel It goes on like butter and leaves your skin completely shinefree and so soft After applying my foundation and lightweight loose powder my skin and makeup stay beautiful all day through any temperature I love this product Thats why Im on Autodelivery,I love nyx products so Im excited to try this on my next photo shoot All of their primers

and I wanted to step up my game and make sure I had complete foundation coverage all day This stuff works I have always moisturized before putting on the tinted moisturizer Now I moisturize wait a while then use this primer then a good foundation The primer keeps the foundation on and helps it spread more evenly Im sold,This is definitely the best primer I have tried It has the same texture as Milani which has been my favorite for many years but it sets into my skin better My skin also looks less oily with it I highly recommend I took off a star because it went from  up to  for the same small size A little disappointing,Excelente transaccin ,Feels good on the skin but  oz is too small a size and the tube didnt last long Not sure if I will order again I use serums that seem to work just as well as a primer,I like the durabilityMy only complaint is its difficult to use all of the product in the container I have to cut the tube to get the last of the product out Usually  to  uses,I bought this back when I believed in primer Its a little greasy but one of the least bad primers Ive ever tried so its a good buy,This primer does a great job of smoothing out your skin and

it really downplays my rosy spots,I got the clear one and its just like the Smashbox Photo Finish primer I love how it oxidizes and doesnt stay greasy in texture Great alternative to the  dollar smashbox tube Will be using this from now on,This has become my standard primerI have a number of very expensive primers but this seems to blur the lines and hold the makeup foundation all dayIt is light weight and has great coverage with minimal amountHighly recommend,I dont use it that often cause you get what you paid for,Feels a little drying for my skin but its a good primer,Love it evens tone,Very good My favorite of that brand,Does the trick and for the price of this compare to others I will stick to NYX that does the exact same and also to save a little ,I reallly like this primer Im  with combo skin and oily Tzone Ive been trying lotion and cream based primers with no luck but this came along and wow Its lightweight has an almost powder finish and a little goes a long way Stays put all day with minimal settlingclumping,MUST HAVE beauty item I can not go without this primer in my makeup bag I think it is better than smashbox primer and much cheaper My foundation goes on so much smoother with this primer,I love this clear primer Its not greasy and my foundation brushes on so smooth I always get compliments on my makeupThis is partially the reason why and Im almost  yrs old,I wanted to put on clown makeup with something underneath to prevent my skin from absorbing itThis seemed to do the trickAlso dont buy clown makeup from WalmartAfter three hours it started cracking and I went from looking like Bozo the Clown to the Joker,good,Little bit greasy  But its OK ,This is the best primer I have used so far,Made my makeup look amazing for hours I fell asleep n woke up looking photo shoot ready  Definitely buying again,I love this primer It goes on silky smooth and is the perfect base for flawless foundation applicationI reduced it by one star because the redness reduction isnt that great There are better products out there if youre looking for actual redness coverage but as a primer this is great and the price is much better than other retailers,This is a fantasticprimer Its silky smooth and lasts all day The green tint however does nothing for redness I saw no difference there but this is still my favorite primer in my makeup box I was previously using Smashbox and I like this one more,good dupe of smashboxs perfecting primer i love it,Best primer I have tried and inexpensive too,This primer is as good as the expensive department store brands It makes my foundation look great through a long day I apply it between moisturizer and foundation for great results,A great dupe for the much more expensive Smashbox photo ready primer Long lasting smooth application and helps create a nice even canvas for foundation and concealer,Smooth application and really helps with the look of my BB cream,goes on smooth love it,It works well just a little greasy for my taste but it did keep my makeup in place all day,First time using a primerIt definitely makes a difference in the texture of my foundationCant really compare it to others but I like this one and will continue to buy,For the size of the bottle its definitely over priced I have no tried it yet but if I do end up loving the product Ill probably end up going into the store to buy it instead of paying over  for a small tube of primer thatll probably be gone in less than a month,It works Greatits my favorite,Omg makes your makeup application amazing,I decided to try this product because it was rated much lower on the Think Dirty app than the primer I was usingIt goes on smoothly and easily and leaves a silky smooth type of feeling after applicationI did not need to allow any time for drying before adding my foundationIt seems to work just as well as my previous primer but it s much cleaner rated  on Think Dirty appI will be buying this again unless I find a  rated primer first,Thanks,Ive gotten this twice now and dont buy to many makeup items twice LOL I use this in conjunction with NYX BB CreamNo longer do I go to that expensive makeup store at the mallIm  and tried it allThis makes my face look bright and not dull,A requested gift she seemed happy,Im very happy with this product Gives the face a velvety feel which is quite lovely Make up glides right on,Great buy,Ive tried many different types of primers but this has been my go to for a couple years now I wouldnt say that it necessarily does very much for masking my redness I have Rosacea but it definitely evens out moisturizes and provides a nice barrier for my skin I like having this barrier between my skin and my makeup so I dont irritate my already sensitive skin any further with makeup I will never not have this product in my makeup bag,I have oily skin and this primer works perfect for me I apply using finger tips and leave to set before applying my foundation My makeup application feels so much easier and smoother to blend when using this product,very smooth helps spread makeup evenly I have very sensitive skin and there has been obsoletely no skin reaction,I really liked this primer It really helped diminish pores and fine lines Its not the best primer Ive used But its no where near the worst,Makes your skin super smooth  allows you to blend foundation easily,Love this green primer I have rosacea and this really helps hide the red while giving my skins a smooth shine free look Much cheaper than other brands and works better,Flawless,Great stuff good price Came quickly,I love this primer It goes on super soft and doesnt look green at all when its rubbed in Im not sure how well it does to offset redness but its still a great primer,I have been using this primer and have found it to be the best for me over the very pricy options My makeup goes on flawlessly and stays beautifulI still have the pricey ones sitting in my drawer,Goes on so smooth and last all day,Bought this as my first experience with primer and I would never go back to my days without it You dont need to use much to tell the difference I bought this estimating about  months ago and its still not out I also dont wear make up everyday though']"
